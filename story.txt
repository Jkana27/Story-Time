Schneewittchen went to a Biergarten for some Bratwust. She was hungry.
Where she met Guass who said, "Stop eating and change your clothes".
She quickly got dressed in lederhose, and they drove in a BMW to a Rammstein concert.
On the way they passed through a flughafen in Berlin, listening to Rammstein musik on CD.
And they finished their night at the Biergarten.
Back at the Biergarten, the patrons were all singing, "We all live in Amerika, Amerika, Amerika" as they were all Rammstein fans as well (what a wonderful night).
They hoped others would be fans of Rammstein but they knew it was a Luftschloss.
Schneewittchen had a kopfkino about some brot, and so they ordered some to enjoy.
