Schneewittchen went to a Biergarten for some Bratwust. She was hungry.
Where she met Guass who said, "Stop eating and change your clothes".
She quickly got dressed in lederhose, and they drove in a BMW to a Rammstein concert.
On the way they passed through a flughafen in Berlin, listening to Rammstein musik on CD.
And they finished their night at the Biergarten.
